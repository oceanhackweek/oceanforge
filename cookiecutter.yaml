about:
  description:  |
    A shared, cloud-native computing environment for ocean scientists — designed for Python and R users to support training in modern ocean data workflows.

    As ocean science enters an era of massive, continuous data streams — spanning remote sensing, autonomous and in situ observing systems, large model outputs, and passive acoustics — OceanForge provides a pre-configured compute environment for ocean data science training and hackathons.
